Any notes that are listed under this directory are for the sole purpose of 
recap and self-evaluation of the knowledge I have learned while
reading and following this textbook.

The notes are NOT going to be a 1:1 copy of the textbook. 
I may copy some phrasings and wordings, but it will NOT be a verbatim 
of the textbook. As such, my notes will be of the relevant information
that I have learned, summarised and formatted to highlight importance.

I may also include other pieces of information that I have learned in
the cases that I may have made further research into a topic or definition
that I needed clarification on. These sections will be 
highlighted accordingly. 

Any relevant links, references, and legends will be noted at the beginning 
and or end of each document.
